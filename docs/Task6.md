# Task 6: FinTech Vendor Scorecard for Micro-Lending

## üéØ Objective
Develop a comprehensive vendor analytics engine that combines NER-extracted entities with engagement metrics to create lending scores for micro-lending decisions.

## üè¶ Business Context

**EthioMart's Micro-Lending Initiative**

EthioMart wants to identify its most active and promising vendors to offer them small business loans (micro-lending). A lender can't assess a vendor based on text alone; they need to see evidence of business activity and customer engagement.

## üìä Vendor Analytics Engine

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### 1. Activity & Consistency
- **Posting Frequency**: Average number of posts per week
- **Activity Period**: How long the vendor has been active
- **Consistency**: Regularity of posting patterns

#### 2. Market Reach & Engagement
- **Average Views per Post**: Primary indicator of customer reach
- **Total Views**: Overall market exposure
- **Best Post Performance**: Peak engagement levels
- **Engagement Consistency**: Reliability of audience reach

#### 3. Business Profile (from NER Model)
- **Average Price Point**: Market segment positioning
- **Product Diversity**: Business breadth and specialization
- **Location Coverage**: Geographic market presence
- **Price Stability**: Business model consistency

## üî¢ Lending Score Calculation

### Weighted Scoring Model (0-100 scale)

```
Lending Score = (Market Reach √ó 30%) + 
                (Activity Level √ó 25%) + 
                (Business Diversification √ó 20%) + 
                (Business Viability √ó 15%) + 
                (Performance Consistency √ó 10%)
```

### Component Details

1. **Market Reach (30%)**
   - Based on average views per post
   - Normalized to 0-1 scale (cap at 2000 views)
   - Indicates customer base size

2. **Activity Level (25%)**
   - Posts per week frequency
   - Normalized to 0-1 scale (cap at 7 posts/week)
   - Shows business commitment

3. **Business Diversification (20%)**
   - Number of unique product types
   - Normalized to 0-1 scale (cap at 5 products)
   - Reduces concentration risk

4. **Business Viability (15%)**
   - Average price point factor
   - Minimum threshold: 500 ETB
   - Indicates sustainable business model

5. **Performance Consistency (10%)**
   - Inverse of engagement variability
   - Lower variability = higher score
   - Shows reliable performance
